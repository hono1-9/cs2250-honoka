            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <!-- Requirement-1.G -->
            <p>Hello! I am Honoka Nagata. I study Computer Science, and since August 2025, I have been studying abroad at Cal Poly Pomona for one year(2 semester).
                At my home university in Japan, I belong to a research lab focusing on <!-- Requirement-1.H --><span style="color: #97c1f1;">security</span>, and after returning I plan to work on my graduation research.
            </p>
            <h3>Out side of classes</h3>
            <p>
                Outside of classes, I have been working as a student mentor, teaching programming to midle and high school students, as well as working part-time job as a tutor and interning at IT company.
                My hobby is driving, photograpy, and traveling.
            </p>
            <h3>Why I chose CPP as my study abroad destination</h3>
            <p>
                I chose to study abroad at Cal Poly Pomona because I wanted to challenge myself in a diverse and global environment.
            </p>
            <h3>Why I Love Traveling</h3>
            <p>
                I love traveling because it allows me to learn about the unique culture and lifestyle of each region.
                I also enjoy driving, so when I travel, I often rent a car to visit places surrounded by nature or try famous local restaurants.<br>
                I haven't traveled much in the U.S. yet, so I'd love to hear your recommendations!
                During my one-year stay here, I'm planning to visit Universal Studios, Disneyland, and New York City.<br>
            </p>
